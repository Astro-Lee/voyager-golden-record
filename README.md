_This project belongs to [OGWW](https://github.com/elliottssu/ogww)ã€‚_

Based on the scan period and waveform example provided on the cover of the Voyager Golden Disc, the image encoded as an audio signal is decoded.

This project forks from [MalteGruber/voyager-record-decoder](https://github.com/MalteGruber/voyager-record-decoder).

On the basis of the original warehouse, a new music playback function is added, and music can be played while decoding.
